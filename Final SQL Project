# The following is a project using a large dataset provided by Break Into Tech

#Analysis

#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to")

SELECT Country, FirstName, LastName, CustomerId 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != "USA"
ORDER BY Country asc
;

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil"
;

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT inv.InvoiceId, cust.Lastname, cust.Firstname, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
INNER JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry='Brazil';

--INNER JOIN appropriate because I only wanted to return invoices that have a matching customer in the 'customers' table.

#OR

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

--LEFT JOIN is useful if there is a chance some invoices do not have a corresponding cutomer. 

--Both queries produced the same information, but the use of INNER JOIN is more efficient for the specific task as there is only interest in records where customers exist.

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT Title, FirstName, LastName
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title='Sales Support Agent';

#OR

SELECT *
FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5 Find a distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry asc;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name. 

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees as emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT i.InvoiceLineId, t.Name
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.TrackId=t.TrackId;

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name and artists name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name as Track, ar.Name as Artist, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t ON i.TrackId=t.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#11 Provide a query that shows all tracks, and include the album name, media type, and genre.

SELECT t.Name as 'Track Name', a.Title as 'Album Title', m.Name as 'Media Type', g.Name as 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a 
ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m 
ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g 
ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

#12 Show the total sales made by each sales agent

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#13 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2)) DESC LIMIT 1;
